# Arduino_Firebase_NodeMCU_ESP8266_Module
This project involves using an Arduino microcontroller to obtain the data from the humidity/temperature, pH, and water level sensors, send these data to the NodeMCU ESP8266 module, which is connected to the Wi-Fi network, and have the ESP8266 push that data onto Google Firebase.

This project is still in progress and any code that has been used from other sources will be cited.

This project is being funded by California State University Fullerton Partnership of Applied Computer Engineering and involves a team of computer engineering students creating the robot from design specifications through testing, programming, and hardware design in order to compete in competitions and lay the ground work for future teams who wish to compete.
